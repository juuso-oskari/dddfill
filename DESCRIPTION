Title: function to fill missing ddd-values from drug purchase data

Description:
    Fills the missing ddd-values in the data according to following logic:
    by default finds the closest prior vnr-matching purchase (if prior not found, finds closest after).
    However, if k_mean given to be different from 1, compares the match with the trimmed mean of (up to) k_mean
    matching purchases both sides to the purchase, and uses that if too big of a difference (reduces possible wrong entry effect).
    For match, calculates the ddd/kust -ratio, which can be then used to fill the missing ddd-value by:
    kust of ddd-missing purchase * ddd/kust -ratio (of closest match or mean of kmean matches around the purchase)
